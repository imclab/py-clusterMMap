    class clusterMMap
     |  clusterMMap - generate a set of clusters and orphaned points for a list of coordinates
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Create a new clusterMMap object. Just like that!
     |  
     |  clusters(self, coords, k=None)
     |      Return a tuple containing the set clustered (sorted) and orphaned
     |      points. Specifically:
     |      
     |      This starts off as plain old K-Means  clustering where, in the absence
     |      of a user-defined value of K, the square-root of the number of markers
     |      is used. After the initial clustering is done the results are filtered
     |      to prevent any single cluster from containing more than nine points
     |      (that should probably be configurable). Any that exceed the limit continue
     |      to be re-crunched (with a K value of 2) until they meet expectations and
     |      even then they are subject to an additional distance test to ensure that
     |      outliers don't get grouped with something that's actually too far away.
     |      That may mean that they end up as "orphan" points but there are hoops to
     |      try and account for that too.
     |      
     |      The clusters are then further simplified by generating a convex hull, or
     |      more precisely tested to see if there are enough points to create a hull.
     |      If not, all the points in that clustered are treated as orphans. So, now
     |      we have a bunch of polylines and orphan points. If the bounding box for
     |      any one polyline contains the bounding box for another polyline or the
     |      bounding box of polyline x intersects polyline y (the actual polyline, not
     |      the bounding box) then the two are merged. Finally, each orphaned point is
     |      tested to see whether it is contained by any of the bounding boxes for the
     |      remaining polylines (and added to that cluster if it does).
     |      
     |      Coords is a list of lists whose elements are (latitude, longitude).
